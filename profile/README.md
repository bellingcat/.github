Welcome to our GitHub, this is where we publish and collaborate on the code for our tools.

If you're looking for our website, head over to [bellingcat.com](https://www.bellingcat.com/).


>[!IMPORTANT]
>:rotating_light: "Help! I want to use your tools for an investigation, but this site is new to me." 
> 
> Welcome, we're glad you made it! :star: We try to write detailed instructions for all of our tools on their individual pages, called *repositories*. The instructions can get technical, but we're always trying to make our tools as easy to use as possible. You can find the tool repositories further down this page.
>
> We also have [guides on our website](https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/how-tos/), which are worth looking at if you haven't already.


## Our tech community

There are folks from all over the world contributing to our code :earth_africa: We believe that by collaborating we can build better, more transparent tools that help investigators all around the globe!

### Want to contribute? :trophy:

We are always happy to welcome new folks into our tech community. Feel free to bring your skills to our repos in comments, issues and pull requests.

Looking for a big challenge, try our [Open Questions](https://github.com/bellingcat/open-questions) :warning: These are tricky long-term projects that could be really valuable for open source investigators.

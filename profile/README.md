Welcome to our GitHub, this is where we publish and collaborate on the code for our tools.

If you're looking for our website, head over to [bellingcat.com](https://www.bellingcat.com/).


>[!IMPORTANT]
>:rotating_light: "Help! I want to use your tools for an investigation, but this site is new to me." 
> 
> Welcome, we're glad you made it! :star: We try to write detailed instructions for all of our tools on their individual pages, called *repositories*. The instructions can get technical, but we're always trying to make our tools as easy to use as possible. You can find the tool repositories further down this page.
>
> We also have [guides on our website](https://www.bellingcat.com/category/resources/how-tos/), which are worth looking at if you haven't already.


## Our tech community

There are folks from all over the world contributing to our code :earth_africa: We believe that by collaborating we can build better, more transparent tools that help investigators all around the globe!

### Want to contribute? :trophy:

We are always happy to welcome new folks into our tech community. Feel free to bring your skills to our repos in comments, issues and pull requests.

For bitesize tasks, have a look through our [Open Issues](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Abellingcat+is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen&type=issues) :eyes: We're planning on using Github projects to organise our community work in the future, but we're not there just yet.

Looking for a big challenge, try our [Open Questions](https://github.com/bellingcat/open-questions) :warning: These are tricky long-term projects that could be really valuable for open source investigators.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Take a look at our [contribution guide :book:](https://github.com/bellingcat/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [community code of conduct :shield:](https://github.com/bellingcat/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for advice on how to get started and the standards that we share.
